# Mobile_Phone_Data

All tasks completed. 
Couldn't get unittests to work as is a new topic. They worked in my first version that was not OOP but then lost them
trying to get back to a previous commit. Hence I started again. 

Task 4 was unclear as to whether all fields were necessary or not, so opted for just the property name, 
client and start and end date formatted in readable columns.
